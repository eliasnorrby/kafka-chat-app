# kafka-chat-app

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/eliasnorrby/kafka-chat-app?style=for-the-badge)](https://travis-ci.com/eliasnorrby/kafka-chat-app)

The purpose of this app is to demo different features of Apache Kafka. Real-time data
is pushed to a web client using websockets.

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run `npm run quickstart`. This installs all dependencies and
starts the development server. Open a few browser tabs pointing to
`localhost:3000` and start chatting.

## Disclaimer

The 'kafka' part of the `kafka-chat-app` is not really ready. For now, the messages are 
only transmitted using websockets.
